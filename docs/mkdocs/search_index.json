Please check back often, and feel free to update from the Syr repo and send a PR if you notice something that isn't right.\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nA Component\n\n\nSyrSDK uses the familiar React JavaScript pattern for creating components. The basic component setup looks like this.\n\n\nimport { Component } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n  }\n  render() {\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nView\n\n\nA \nView\n component is the basic component that renders to a surface (the \nRootView\n). This component can be rendered to a \nSyrRootView\n.\n\n\nimport { View } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nView\n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt can also own components, that will render to the surface as a child. Such as another \nView\n.\n\n\nimport { View } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nView\n\n      \nView\n/View\n\n  \n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nBecause a View does not have any dimensions by default, it will render at X,Y:0,0 and Height,Width:0,0. To change this you can attach a style.\n\n\nimport { View } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nView style={{\n    height: 100,\n    width: 100,\n    left: 50,\n    top: 50\n  }}\n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nTextView\n\n\nA text view MUST OWN text. We're following this rule from React Native and sticking with it. Text that is not inside a TextView node, will become a \nvalue\n property on nodes that own them. So if you need Text that displays, then you need to ensure it's wrapped inside a \nTextView\n\n\nimport { TextView } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nTextView\n/TextView\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnimated.View\n\n\nAn animated view lets the bridge know about any special conditions that need to be setup ahead of time for the animation. Currently this stub exists for Syntax compatibility. In SyrSDK any component that is derived from an animatable is, able to have an animation applied. UIView, Button, Image.\n\n\nimport { Animated } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nAnimated.View\n/Animated.View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nA component for displaying an Image. It is self terminated as it can not hold any children.\n\n\nimport { Image } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nImage source={{uri:\nfile_name\n}} style={{ height:150, width:300 }}/\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nButton\n\n\nA clickable component. Returns an onPress event.\n\n\nimport { Button } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nButton onPress={this.onPress} style={{ height:150, width:300 }}\nPress Me\n/Button\n\n}\nonPress(){\n  // the button was pressed!\n}\n\n\n\n\nTouchableOpacity\n\n\nAn invisible clickable view. Use it to encapsulate components for which you want to receive a click handler.\n\n\nTouchableOpacity onPress={()=\nthis.handleBackPress()} style={styles.iconContainer}\n\n  \nImage\n    style={styles.icon}\n    source={{ uri: 'icon' }}\n  /\n\n\n/TouchableOpacity\n\n\n\n\n\nScrollView\n\n\nA component that introduces scrolling around content inside. We calculate the max Y and max X, and set the content of the scroll view.\n\n\nScrollView style={styles.scrollView}\n\n  \nView style={styles.view}\n/View\n\n\n/ScrollView\n\n\n\n\n\nStackView\n\n\nwatch out! this is under heavy development!\n\nStackView allows a developers to align and space out content. In lieu of having React-Native's Yoga (Flexbox), we leverage built in layout controls.\n\n\n \nStackView\n            axis=\nvertical\n\n            style={style}\n\n \n/StackView\n\n\n\n\n\nStyling a component\n\n\nwatch out! this is under heavy development!\n\n\nStyling a component is much like basic \nReact-Native\n. Create a JavaScript literal that describes the layout properties that you would like to affect.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  height: 50,\n  width: 100\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou then bind the style to the rendering node.\n\n\nrender() {\n  return \nView style={style}\n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\nSet the height of a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  height: 50\n}\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nSet the width of a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  width: 100\n}\n\n\n\n\nleft\n\n\nSet the origin left for a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  left: 50\n}\n\n\n\n\ntop\n\n\nSet the origin top of a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  top: 50\n}\n\n\n\n\nRendering\n\n\nSyrSDK uses the concept of a \nraster\n. It tries to detect the environment it's in, based on the availability of the \nSyrNative\n bridge. Rendering to the \nRootView\n surface is as easy as creating the component, and handing it to the raster.\n\n\nWe recommend, that you use a top level component for an entry. And use this as top level logic for your application. Once handed to the Raster, it will become an instance, and it's logic and program will run starting with it's \nconstructor\n, and then the \nlifeCycle\n events.\n\n\nimport { Component, Render } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return \nView\n/View\n\n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeCycle\n\n\nSyr supports Life Cycle events to help control the flow of the program. To take advantage of these add the following to javascript classes.\n\n\nMethod stubs\n\n\nimport { Component } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    // runs when object is created in javascript\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // when what this class should return as it's rendering tree\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // this fires when component has been added to the rendering surface\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    // fires when component is removed from rendering surface\n  }\n\n  componentWillUpdate() {\n    // fires immediately before rendering when new props or state are being received\n  }\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate() {\n    // fires before component will update, you can return false\n    // to prevent an update\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    // component updated, runs after the component state was changed\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nNotifying JavaScript from Native\n\n\nIf you need to notify the JavaScript from the Native layer, you can send events, from your native component. The easiest way to get access to this event, is to subclass \nSyrComponent.h\n.\n\n\n[self sendEventWithName:@\nFooParty\n body:@{@\nname\n: eventName}];\n\n\n\n\nSubscribing to Events from JavaScript\n\n\nJavaScript can subscribe to the events that are being passed down from the native layer.\n\n\nimport { NativeEventEmitter } from 'syr';\n\n\nconst subscription = NativeEventEmitter.addListener(\n  'FooParty',\n  (event) =\n console.log(event.name)\n);\n\n// unsubscribe when needed\nsubscription.remove();\n\n\n\n\nAnimations\n\n\nSyr has support for animations. With Syr animations you can run animations transitions in parallel, or sequence. Animations allow for the shift in x,y position and size. If you need a more complex animation you can use \nAnimated.Value\n to bind a transform to the component.\n\n\nSlide\n\n\nimport { Component, Render, Animated } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    // slide animation\n    this.slideAnimation = new Animated.XYValue({\n      x: 0\n      y: 0\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \nAnimated.View style={{\n        height: 100,\n        width: 100,\n        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',\n        transform: [this.slideAnimation]\n      }}\n\n      \n/Animated.View\n\n    );\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(this.slideAnimation, {\n      toValue: {\n        x:100,\n        y:100\n      },\n      duration: 5000\n    }).start()\n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\nRotation\n\n\nimport { Component, Render, Animated } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    // interpolation animation\n    this.spinAnimation = new Animated.Value(0);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \nAnimated.View style={{\n        height: 100,\n        width: 100,\n        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',\n        top: 50,\n        left: 50,\n        transform: [this.spinAnimation]\n      }}\n\n      \n/Animated.View\n\n    );\n  }\n  spin() {\n    //spin the object 360 degress. and repeat after 5 seconds\n    Animated.timing(this.spinAnimation, {\n      toValue: 360,\n      duration: 5000\n    }).start(()=\n{\n      this.spin();\n    });\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.spin();\n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\nCreating Native Modules\n\n\nSyr lets you create native modules that can bridge across the native to web spectrum. They are capable of providing renderable (Views, Text, Buttons), and having methods callable from JavaScript.\n\n\nSyr Native Modules are always used in the \nClass\n invocation method. What this means is that if you want to store instanced information (some value) on your class \nNatively\n you need to use the \nsharedDelegate\n pattern.\n\n\nBuilding your first class\n\n\nMyNativeModule.h\n\n\n#import \nSyrComponent.h\n\n\n@interface MyNativeModule : SyrComponent\n@end\n\n\n\n\nMyNativeModule.m\n\n\n#import \nMyNativeModule.h\n\n\n@implementation MyNativeModule\n\n// send this class to the JS bridge\nSYR_EXPORT_MODULE();\n\n// this is an objective C method that will get it's invokation from JS\nSYR_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location)\n{\n  // do something with Name and Location strings\n}\n\n// if you want to use this module in the JSX tree\n// there are helper methods on the component to help with\n// styling and more\n+(NSObject*) render: (NSDictionary*) component {\n  UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] init];\n  return view;\n}\n\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the native modules from javascript.\n\n\nimport { NativeModules } from 'syr';\n\nlet MyNativeModule = NativeModules.MyNativeModule;\n\nMyNativeModule.addEvent('building an app', 'at my desk');",

Once handed to the Raster, it will become an instance, and it's logic and program will run starting with it's  constructor , and then the  lifeCycle  events.  import { Component, Render } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return  View /View \n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);",
