Please check back often, and feel free to update from the Syr repo and send a PR if you notice something that isn't right.\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nA Component\n\n\nSyrSDK uses the familiar React JavaScript pattern for creating components. The basic component setup looks like this.\n\n\nimport { Component } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n  }\n  render() {\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nView\n\n\nA \nView\n component is the basic component that renders to a surface (the \nRootView\n). This component can be rendered to a \nSyrRootView\n.\n\n\nimport { View } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nView\n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt can also own components, that will render to the surface as a child. Such as another \nView\n.\n\n\nimport { View } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nView\n\n      \nView\n/View\n\n  \n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nBecause a View does not have any dimensions by default, it will render at X,Y:0,0 and Height,Width:0,0. To change this you can attach a style.\n\n\nimport { View } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nView style={{\n    height: 100,\n    width: 100,\n    left: 50,\n    top: 50\n  }}\n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnimated.View\n\n\nAn animated view lets the bridge know about any special conditions that need to be setup ahead of time for the animation. Currently this stub exists for Syntax compatibility. In SyrSDK any component that is derived from an animatable is, able to have an animation applied. UIView, Button, Image.\n\n\nimport { Animated } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nAnimated.View\n/Animated.View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nTextView\n\n\nA text view MUST OWN text. We're following this rule from React Native and sticking with it. Text that is not inside a TextView node, will become a \nvalue\n property on nodes that own them. So if you need Text that displays, then you need to ensure it's wrapped inside a \nTextView\n\n\nimport { TextView } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nTextView\n/TextView\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nA component for displaying an Image. It is self terminated as it can not hold any children.\n\n\nimport { Image } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nImage source={{uri:\nfile_name\n}} style={{ height:150, width:300 }}/\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nButton\n\n\nA clickable component. Returns an onPress event.\n\n\nimport { Button } from 'syr';\n\nrender(){\n  return \nButton onPress={this.onPress} style={{ height:150, width:300 }}\nPress Me\n/Button\n\n}\nonPress(){\n  // the button was pressed!\n}\n\n\n\n\nLinearGradient\n\n\nA \nView\n that has a linear gradient applied to the background.\n\n\nimport { LinearGradient } from 'syr';\n\nrender() {\n  return \nLinearGradient colors={['#000000', '#FFFFFF']} style={{ height:150, width:300 }}/\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nTouchableOpacity\n\n\nAn invisible clickable view. Use it to encapsulate components for which you want to receive a click handler.\n\n\nimport { TouchableOpacity, Image } from 'syr';\n\nrender() {\n  return \nTouchableOpacity onPress={()=\nthis.handleBackPress()} style={styles.iconContainer}\n\n          \nImage\n            style={styles.icon}\n            source={{ uri: 'icon' }}\n          /\n\n  \n/TouchableOpacity\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nScrollView\n\n\nA component that introduces scrolling around content inside. We calculate the max Y and max X, and set the content of the scroll view.\n\n\nimport { ScrollView, View } from 'syr';\n\nrender() {\n  return \nScrollView style={{height: 300, width: 300}}\n\n      \nView style={{height: 500, width: 500}}\n/View\n\n  \n/ScrollView\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nStackView\n\n\n\u2620\ufe0f\nwatch out! this is under heavy development!\n\n\nStackView allows a developers to align and space out content. In lieu of having React-Native's Yoga (Flexbox), we leverage built in layout controls.\n\n\nimport { StackView, View } from 'syr';\n\nrender() {\n  return \nStackView\n            axis=\nvertical\n\n            style={style}\n\n    \nView style={{height: 50, width: 50}}\n/View\n\n    \nView style={{height: 50, width: 50}}\n/View\n\n    \nView style={{height: 50, width: 50}}\n/View\n\n  \n/StackView\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nStyling a component\n\n\n\u2620\ufe0f\nwatch out! this is under heavy development!\n\n\nStyling a component is much like basic \nReact-Native\n. Create a JavaScript literal that describes the layout properties that you would like to affect.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  height: 50,\n  width: 100\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou then bind the style to the rendering node.\n\n\nrender() {\n  return \nView style={style}\n/View\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\nSet the height of a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  height: 50\n}\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nSet the width of a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  width: 100\n}\n\n\n\n\nleft\n\n\nSet the origin left for a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  left: 50\n}\n\n\n\n\ntop\n\n\nSet the origin top of a frame.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  top: 50\n}\n\n\n\n\ncolor\n\n\nSet the foreground color of a component. Normally text color. Accepts HEX and RGBA.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  color: '#FFFFFF'\n}\n\n\n\n\nbackgroundColor\n\n\nSet the background color of a component. Accepts HEX and RGBA.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  backgroundColor: '#000000'\n}\n\n\n\n\nborderRadius\n\n\nSet the border radius of a component. Slight variations exist for curvature on each platform. Combine with PixelRatio to soften corners.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  borderRadius: 15\n}\n\n\n\n\nborderWidth\n\n\nSet the width of the border on a component.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  borderWidth: 3\n}\n\n\n\n\nborderColor\n\n\nSet the color of the border on a component. Accepts HEX and RGBA.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  borderColor: '#FF00FF'\n}\n\n\n\n\nfontSize\n\n\nSet the font size, normally only useful for \nTextView\n. Due to variations in screen sizes, we recommend using \nPixelRatio\n to obtain the DisplayPoint to PixelSize.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  fontSize: 24\n}\n\n\n\n\nfontWeight\n\n\nSet the font weight, normally only useful for \nTextView\n. Currently accepts \nnormal\n or \nbold\n.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  fontWeight: 'bold'\n}\n\n\n\n\ntextAlign\n\n\n\u2620\ufe0f\nwatch out! this is under heavy development!\n\n\nSet the text alignment direction. Currently accepts \nleft\n|\ncenter\n|\nright\n. These will be changing to \nstart\n|\nmiddle\n|\nend\n once internationalization support lands.\n\n\nlet style = {\n  textAlign: 'center'\n}\n\n\n\n\nRendering\n\n\nSyrSDK uses the concept of a \nraster\n. It tries to detect the environment it's in, based on the availability of the \nSyrNative\n bridge. Rendering to the \nRootView\n surface is as easy as creating the component, and handing it to the raster.\n\n\nWe recommend, that you use a top level component for an entry. And use this as top level logic for your application. Once handed to the Raster, it will become an instance, and it's logic and program will run starting with it's \nconstructor\n, and then the \nlifeCycle\n events.\n\n\nimport { Component, Render } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return \nView\n/View\n\n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeCycle\n\n\nSyr supports Life Cycle events to help control the flow of the program. To take advantage of these add the following to javascript classes.\n\n\nMethod stubs\n\n\nimport { Component } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    // runs when object is created in javascript\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // when what this class should return as it's rendering tree\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // this fires when component has been added to the rendering surface\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    // fires when component is removed from rendering surface\n  }\n\n  componentWillUpdate() {\n    // fires immediately before rendering when new props or state are being received\n  }\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate() {\n    // fires before component will update, you can return false\n    // to prevent an update\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    // component updated, runs after the component state was changed\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nNotifying JavaScript from Native\n\n\nIf you need to notify the JavaScript from the Native layer, you can send events, from your native component. The easiest way to get access to this event.\n\n\n\n                \n\n                    \n        \n\n            \n        \n\n            \niOS\n\n        \n\n    \n        \n\n            \nAndroid\n\n        \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n        \n\n            \n        \n\n            \n[self sendEventWithName:@\nFooParty\n body:@{@\nname\n: @\nparty at my desk\n}];\n\n\n        \n\n    \n        \n\n            \nHashMap\nString, String\n eventPayload = new HashMap\nString, String\n();\neventPayload.put(\nname\n, \npart at my desk\n);\nSyrInstance.getInstance(this).sendEvent(\nFooParty\n, \nparty at my desk\n)\n\n\n        \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n                \n\n                    \n\n\nSubscribing to Events from JavaScript\n\n\nJavaScript can subscribe to the events that are being passed down from the native layer.\n\n\nimport { NativeEventEmitter } from 'syr';\n\n\nconst subscription = NativeEventEmitter.addListener(\n  'FooParty',\n  (event) =\n console.log(event.name)\n);\n\n// unsubscribe when needed\nsubscription.remove();\n\n\n\n\nAnimations\n\n\nSyr has support for animations. With Syr animations you can run animations transitions in parallel, or sequence. Animations allow for the shift in x,y position and size. If you need a more complex animation you can use \nAnimated.Value\n to bind a transform to the component.\n\n\nSlide\n\n\nimport { Component, Render, Animated } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    // slide animation\n    this.slideAnimation = new Animated.XYValue({\n      x: 0\n      y: 0\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \nAnimated.View style={{\n        height: 100,\n        width: 100,\n        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',\n        transform: [this.slideAnimation]\n      }}\n\n      \n/Animated.View\n\n    );\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(this.slideAnimation, {\n      toValue: {\n        x:100,\n        y:100\n      },\n      duration: 5000\n    }).start()\n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\nRotation\n\n\nimport { Component, Render, Animated } from 'syr';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    // interpolation animation\n    this.spinAnimation = new Animated.Value(0);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \nAnimated.View style={{\n        height: 100,\n        width: 100,\n        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',\n        top: 50,\n        left: 50,\n        transform: [this.spinAnimation]\n      }}\n\n      \n/Animated.View\n\n    );\n  }\n  spin() {\n    //spin the object 360 degress. and repeat after 5 seconds\n    Animated.timing(this.spinAnimation, {\n      toValue: 360,\n      duration: 5000\n    }).start(()=\n{\n      this.spin();\n    });\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.spin();\n  }\n}\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\nOS\n\n\nRetrieve the \nPlatform\n name the application running under.\n\n\nlet OS = Platform.OS // \nios\n || \nandroid\n || \nbrowser_name\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nRetrieve the version of the \nPlatform\n the application is running under. For \niOS\n returns the version running. For \nAndroid\n, returns the API level. For \nWeb\n returns the browser version.\n\n\nlet Version = Platform.Version // iOS : 11.2 , Android : 24 , Web : 63\n\n\n\n\nisWeb\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\ndeviates from react-native\n\n\nProvides \nboolean\n value, if the application is displaying inside a Web Browser or now.\n\n\nif(Platform.isWeb) {\n  // do something with web platform\n}\n\n\n\n\nPixel Ratio\n\n\nIf you are creating cross platform applications, you typically need to deal with varied resolutions across similar physical screens, and densities of physical pixels that map to virtual pixels. The \nPixelRatio\n class can help you detect values you need to ensure you have consistent layouts across platforms.\n\n\nget\n\n\nReturns the pixel ratio of the device. Use this ratio to determine which quality images you should be using in your application. Returns a precision value, such as \n1, 1.5, 2, 2.5\n.

This is the \nInstance-Tree\n for the application.\n\n\nWhen using Syr, a \nComponent\n is defined. This base \nComponent\n is then constructed at \nrun-time\n and represents the application for the entirety of its existence inside the \nGuest\n system. We transport messages with this structure to the \nHost\n system, where rendering is setup.\n\n\nA basic component defined in Syr.\n\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return \nView\nHello World\n/View\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSince JavaScript constructors are sugared function constructors we end up with an object with a \nrender\n function attached that will return an AST structure.\n\n\nWhat about the JSX?\n\n\n\nIf you're not familiar with \nJSX\n, a quick recap is that it is a way for us to represent JavaScript \nClasses\n in an elegant composition based manner.\n\n\nSyr ships with a \nJSX\n transform for \nBabel\n. We've forked this implementation from \nbabel-plugin-transform-jsx\n by Caleb Meredith. One feature added is \nUUID\n at transpile time. We leverage this to recompute state without needing to diff a tree and transport those changes to the Host system.\n\n\nSyr transpiles \nJSX\n directly into an AST tree. Following is an example of what JSX looks like, and what the corresponding tree looks like after going through \nBabel\n.\n\n\nView\n\n    \nText\nHello World\n/Text\n\n\n/View\n\n\n\n\n\nConverts into\n\n\n{\n    elementName: function(), // instanceof View\n    attributes: {},\n    children: [\n        {\n            elementName: function(), // instanceof Text\n            attributes: {},\n            children: []\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe have an AST Tree now what?\n\n\n\nWhen the application is parsed and loaded, it sits idle until the developer executes the \nRender\n method.\n\n\nRender(MyComponent);\n\n\n\n\nThis method takes the AST from the component and creates instances of the classes for the tree. It then uses the \nJavaScript to Native Bridge\n to send messages containing the UI structure. \n\n\nSyr's \nHost\n Bridge implementations receive the AST Tree representing the UI. The Bridge sends this tree to the Raster, where the elements are constructed on the \nHost\n environment, and cached against the \nUUID\n for later state control. \n\n\nThe \nHost\n environment attaches these controls to a \nRootView\n, and once complete sends a message back to the \nGuest\n environment, informing it of the \nUUID\n which was constructed and rendered, and kicks off the \ncomponentDidMount\n lifecycle event.\n\n\nThe \nHost\n environment and the \nGuest\n environment exchange a series of messages that continue while the application is executing. We'll continue to break those Classes down in future posts, stay tuned!\n\n\nWant to contribute? Head over to our \nissues\n page, and grab one to work on today!
